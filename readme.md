# DHIS2 web portal Wordpress plugin wins best new app 

This years' DHIS2 conference was held online, Sept 21-24; [see the sessions on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoMfHqbvhx8&list=PLo6Seh-066Ry07Eicb2QhE3B5URWZPbb2) to learn more about what's new. 

Keeping with the conference tradition, on the final day DHIS2 implementers from around the world enter a competition: submitting custom applications that may serve the wider community; tools apps plugins etc. that are open source and extend the use of the DHIS2. The top tools are voted on my conference participants.

This year, LogicalOutcomes is proud to announce the winner: a DHIS2 web portal plugin developed by Stephen Ocaya of StephOcay Limited, and the HISP Uganda team. This plugin allows Wordpress websites to pull select DHIS2 reports/content into the site. In other words, creating a public DHIS2 dashboard outside of the DHIS2 software. 

This plugin was initiated by Catholic Relief Services’ Rapid Response Mechanism in Mali financed by USAID/BHA, with contributions from LogicalOutcomes.

The 'DHIS2 Analytics' is a WordPress Guttenberg Block plugin is available on [Catholic Relief Services' GitHub page](https://github.com/crsorggithub/DHIS2-Wordpress-Plugin)

# Software Manual
## DHIS2 Analytics
Edition: January 2020
Version: 1.0.6

DHIS2 Analytics is a WordPress Guttenberg Block plugin developed by Stephocay Limited with financial support from Catholic Relief Services (CRS) through LogoicalOutcomes. The plugin is developed to display DHIS2 dashboards within a WordPress page.  Without the support from CRS and technical guidance by LogicalOutcomes, this project would have been made possible. On behalf of the project team, I would like to thank and pass a vote of thanks to all that have contributed to this first version of the plugin and hopefully develop a community to support its usage beyond its current state. Thanks to the dedicated software developers for making this project a success.

 A Block is a a piece of content that can be inserted on a WordPress post or page. WordPress 5.0 + comes with an inbuilt Guttenberg Block Editors that supports adding a block into a page or post using a simplified user interface. The DHIS2 Analytics plugin is a custom Wordpress Guttenberg block developed to display DHIS2 dashboards.  In this guide, we’re going to introduce the Gutenberg DHIS2 Analytics blocks system and show you how to use it


### 3.1 Adding a block to your post or page
To Add a DHIS2 Analytics block on your WordPress post or page, identify the section within your new or existing post or page that you need to display DHIS2 dashboards and decide whether to display the contents as single item, slideshow or grid. Follow the steps below to add a block.
To add any Guttenberg block, within your block editor, look for the ![+](2020-02-28/plus.png) icon on top of the page or by hovering your mouse within the section that you need to add the block.
At the top of the post or page, the first ![+](2020-02-28/plus.png) icon on the left:

Within your post or page, hover your mouse in the section that you need to add the block, and click the plus icon there.

![](2020-02-28/image22.png)

Within the page, you can also see the most recently used block icons.
All Guttenberg blocks are accessible through this approach and are grouped into most used, common blocks, formatting, layout elements, widgets, embeds and ultimate blocks. DHIS2 analytics can be found in the Common Blocks Category.

Select the DHIS2 Analytics Block to add in your post or page.
DHIS2 Analytics Block will connect to DHIS2 instance configured and pull all the available dashboards. Each dashboard has dashboard items that you can select to display in your post.

NOTES:
* Maps requires height to be set in px. We have defaulted the height to 440px. If you need custom height, specify in px e.g. 300px.

### 3.2.2 Display Settings

In all cases, you can set the display size for the block, by default, it is in Full size  or you can select Custom Size and specify the width and height in Pixels (px).

#### Single Item Display
